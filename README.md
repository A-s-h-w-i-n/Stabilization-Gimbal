# Stabilization-Gimbal
A Servo controlled suto-stabilising gimbal implemented using PID control system.

The system uses an MPU6050 accelerometer. The accelerometer need to be mounted properly 
for the gimbal to work correctly. this might take some trial and error.

The PID coefficients would need to be tuned according the users' needs and the size and 
weight of the components and payload used.
